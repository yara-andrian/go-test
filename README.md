# Experiments in Go
A repository with code for myself to learn and practice Golang using practical applications.

## Running Applications
All projects use `Makefile`s to execute.

In any directory, run `make init` to initialise the project.

To run the project in development, use `make dev`.

To run the project in production, use `make prod`.
